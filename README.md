## Eye Exercise

### Description:
This is a project that I edited for MIT xPRO's web development class. The goal was to add a second eye to the screen. 

Most of the code was provided for me by MIT xPRO. 
 
I added a second 'eye' div with a 'ball' child to the index.html file and then wrote a for-loop in the eyes.js file so that both eyes track the mouse (originally, there was only one eye tracking the mouse). 

I also added a borders to the eyeballs so that they now have green irises (as opposed to only pupils) and changed the background color of the body. 

#### How to Run: 

Open the index.html file in a browser, and the eyes should track your mouse as it moves across the screen.  

#### Support:

N/A

#### Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
I would like for the eyes to be centered on the screen.
